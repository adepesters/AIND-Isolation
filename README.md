As part of this Udacity AI Nanodegree project, I built an adversarial search agent that can play the game 'Isolation', in which two players alternatively move a piece on a checkerboard to progressively occupy cells until one of the players (the loser) cannot perform legal moves anymore. 

Goals of the project were to implement:

-the minimax search algorithm
-alpha-beta pruning
-fixed-depth or iterative deepening search
-custom position evaluation heuristics.
